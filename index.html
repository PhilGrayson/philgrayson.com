            <h4>PHP Developer at Ebuyer.com, July 2013 - present</h4>
            <h4>Undergraduate IT Developer at Ebuyer.com, July 2011 - August 2012</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
Integrated three different product search and navigation systems. Two of which are systems maintained in house. Developed a competing system as an automatic backup when the primary system fails. Written using ElasticSearch, it also serves Search as you Type results.
              </li>
              <li>
Helped to introduce Infrastructure as Code using Puppet. Created centralised configuration. Use Roles and Profile pattern to describe a server's state. Development environments created using same Puppet code in a local virtual machine.
                <ul>
                    <li>
Developed a custom Puppet function to build PHP files. These files contain environment specific application config like database hostnames and login credentials. The values come from yaml configuration stored in a restricted repository.
                    </li>
                    <li>
Developed automation to handle data center fail over. Daemons and crons are data center aware. Processing scripts run in the primary data center only. File backups run in the passive data center.
                    </li>
                    <li>
SSH keys managed in Puppet with yaml configuration. Manages per user which key to install on a server. Client keys white listed (<code>authorized_keys</code>). Server hosts trusted (<code>known_hosts</code>). Automatic swapping of <code>authorized_keys</code> and <code>known_hosts</code> values during data center fail over.
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
Integrated Jenkins to provide an automated build and deployment server. Unit and integration tests are ran when a developer pushes code using git. Developers get notified when their branches fail the automated tests. 
                <ul>
                  <li>Developed deploy and rollback scripts in bash. Automatic deploys to disaster recovery data center.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
Worked with four others to develop a new Payment processing system. Designed new HTTP API for legacy system integration. Migrated hundreds of thousands of sensitive card details. Particular care taken to handle imagined errors and failures without losing information. Designed redundancy to protected against unknown failure modes. Used RabbitMQ in a worker pattern to distribute jobs and save data in case of database failure. 
              </li>
              <li>
Involved with application benchmarking. Replayed Apache log traffic to identify performance bottlenecks in a new customer facing website. Metrics analysed using tools such as Graphite and Kibana. PHP benchmarking done through xhprof.
                <ul>
                  <li>
Maintains the PHP packages used on rewrite systems. PHP package includes performance increase in <code>strtr</code>, a frequently used function in the Zend Framework 2 library. <a href="http://markmail.org/message/w6lez2c6vlgaupay">http://goo.gl/kYBQ74</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
Further modification to PHP's source in <code>json_encode()</code>. Handle graceful serialization non UTF-8 encoded strings (for example Windows 1251).
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>BSc in Software Development, First-Class</h4>
            <p>Modules include Algorithms in Java, Client and Server programming in Java and C, Logic/AI in Prolog, Digital Forensics and and Web/Database development in Ruby and MySQL.</p>
            <p>Final year project was a Tag Management system, inspired by Google Tag Manager. Embedded Javascript would retrieve a list of tags to inject onto a page. Included admin UI section to add and edit Tags for injection on different pages. A reporting suite displayed basic tag analytics. Developed in Symfony2. Extra focus on homogeneous development and production environments. Demonstrating the use of Puppet to maintain machine state.</p>
