                <p>I created a web service which centralises the configuration, embedding and reporting of the affiliate HTML on a merchantâ€™s website. The service is functionally similar to commerical products like Tagman and Google Tag Manager.

                <p>My reports describe and demonstrate techniques to recover digital artifacts such as deleted files, emails and internet usage records. The NTFS and FAT file system metatdata is described from the point of view of deleted file recovery and worked examples showing the differences are given.

                The concept and challeges of distributed applications is discussed. Solutions such as socket programming, remote method invocation, tuple-space and CORBA are presented. The module is assessed by two software products using a provided tuple-space and CORBA library.
                </p>
                <p>
                To demonstrate the application of tuple-space I created a chat-room program that provides functionality similar to IRC. The <a href="https://river.apache.org">Apache River</a> library was uses to distribute Java Objects between clients. A contrived early warning flood detection system was built to demonsatate the use of CORBA in both a Java desktop program and Python web application.
